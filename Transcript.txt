morning and Welcome to our second in a series of webinars for Waterloo grad ready which is a virtual transition program designed for helping new graduate students start their grad school Journeys and second for the second webinar we're going to focus on topics surrounding International students so I'll start going over because we have a lot of content that we're going to go through I'll start going over the housekeeping items and that should give you a minute or two in case you're still settling in to finish settling in so if you're new to the team's live event platform uh you have the option of turning on captions to help you ingest the content a little bit easier if you'd like and for turning on captions if they're not on already you can use the gear icon at the bottom right corner of your screen and click on captions in English and there's there's visuals on the screen to help you guide through the process in terms of uh asking questions we have a q a section and teams live events which you can use to type your questions in you will notice that you're not able to just unmute yourself and ask the questions over voice that just helps us control the in and out of processing of questions a little easier so if you want to access the Q a at the top right you will see two bubbles with a question mark in them and that's the Q a section uh the questions first come to us for review approval and we have the option to either publish them so that everybody can see the question or not so there's two options if you'd like to you know not have the question publish or protect your name from appearing so you can either check post as Anonymous so that we don't see who's asking the question and if you'd like that we don't publish the question at all if it's of a personal nature or some other reason please mention so as a part of the question so that we don't publish it because if we see a question that we think that everybody can benefit from we we generally do publish it along with the response and uh another thing to keep in mind is uh please be mindful of the language used in the Q a section both for questions and otherwise uh because inappropriate language will not be tolerated as grad ready um support we we want to create safe spaces for all students to feel a sense of community and uh yeah inappropriate language will not be tolerated for that and a lot of people ask us and the answer is yes we are recording the module and we will upload the recording in case you want to revisit it or somebody's missing the live version and just want to watch it later the recording will be posted in about four or five working days it will be undergrad ready modules which is inside of learn and there's a tab called live webinar recordings uh you will find you will see this this recording there a lot of people also ask us if we they're going to get access to the static slides and because this is an international students webinar uh the answer for that unfortunately is no a lot of the content is time dependent and we wouldn't want to give you information that potentially is changed in a few months so what we will do instead is we will give you access to the recording so that you know that this is dependent on time and any links that you see during the presentation will be shared in the Q a so you can access the links but the actual content and the slides themselves will unfortunately not be shared but that is just we want to make sure that you have access to only have access to information that is up to date otherwise you don't so please note that before I proceed I'd like to make a land acknowledgment the University of Waterloo is on lands that are deeply connected to the indigenous peoples who have historically lived and who currently live in this territory these groups include the neutral the anishinabe and the harino Shawnee peoples the University of Waterloo is situated on the holidayman tract the land that was promised to the Six Nations and it includes 10 kilometers on each side of the Grand River uh this is just a short description but if you'd like to learn more about the indigenous initiatives that the university is a part of I highly encourage you to visit the the what their website which is uh the office of the indigenous initiatives that's where all the efforts are centralized and we will put a link in the Q a for your convenience with that I'd like to introduce myself and my team was who will be moderating this webinar today my name is and I'm a PhD student with the faculty of engineering and I work as a discipline specialist for the graduate program which itself is housed under as a Student Success office and with me I have Julia Goyle who is a PhD candidate with the faculty of health and also with the faculty of engineering so she's sort of cross-appointed and she's also a discipline specialist and completing our Trifecta of discipline Specialists is ajua who is a PhD candidate in sustainability management and she joined us to help support in-person events but she's now just supporting all aspects of grad ready and we're looking forward to supporting you starting your grad Journey and it gives me a lot of pleasure to introduce our presenters for today uh we have Clint macfee who is an immigration consultant with the Student Success office uh leave Janice spitler who is a student finance associate and we have a indita gachin who is an international students program specialist for the Student Success office and uh they've all done this many times and they all known what the pain points and the common questions are and the best way to address them so we have them here for for you to finally get uh any confusion around finances or or immigration student visa Etc and even International students settling into a new place so without further Ado we'll start off with the first presenter Clint thank you to go um good morning good afternoon good evening everyone um glad you could join us today for this session um my role in this is to kind of go over some of the most important integration points to consider you know for your journey to Canada um just want to note again I think I mentioned but all this information is accurate as of today June 20th um things do change especially with immigration there's always policies shifting so if you're watching the video please keep that in mind um the date this was aired okay let's move into the content so um I'm part of the immigration Consulting team uh that works out of the Student Success office on campus um we are a pretty big team uh we have Luan non and green Hussein myself uh Stephanie handbook because Kurt Leon uh maternity leave Jessica McCormick all of us are regulated Canadian immigration Consultants which means we're registered with the government of Canada to provide immigration advice and this is a great team they're all very you know eager to help and they're very knowledgeable so I just like to put in a quick props to everyone there um what can we help with so normally we focus on temporary residence applications right so study and work permits uh both for you know initial applications and extensions of those permits entering Canada restoring your status if it were to expire and we also advise on U.S visitor visas which is the B1 B2 Visa we offer a number of working and Canada resources so we have workshops and information on social insurance number and general work authorizations which is a big one especially for grad students coming in like how much can you work where can you work our scope of service is really limited to Temporary residence applications so you know there is the whole realm of permanent residents we don't really advise on that just because it's a whole other field of advising and most of our students are here in a temporary status you can use our service while you're enrolled as an active student once you're matriculated and up to two terms after you finish your program so you know feel free to contact us even after you graduate so we can still assist with temporary residence applications we do have a dedicated website housed under the Student Success office umbrella and this is the link to that site there's a lot of information on there to digest but it is broken up into like types of applications working in Canada um and a few other things like in general immigration policy that will impact you as a student so if you're if you want some reading material please check it out there's a lot there uh and there might be answers to some more general questions available on the website you can also use the website to book an appointment for an immigration consultation um which can be useful I'm very quickly going to cover the basics today so we're going to talk about your immigration documents in general uh working in Canada work authorizations something called the post-graduation work permit uh entering Canada contacting ircc and that's sort of a quick wrap up so I'm going to Jump Right In and let's look at identity and immigration documents so I think everybody knows about passports I'm not going to talk too much about them the main thing to know here is that if you're applying let's say for a study permit they won't issue the study permit beyond the expiry date of the passport you used to apply so if your passport's expiring in a year and your program is two or three years they will only issue the study permit for the year and then once you get a new passport you would have to extend your study permit with a new passport uh it's really important that you make a really good color copy of your passport because once in a while you know students do lose their passports um and it's always good to have a backup just for immigration purposes right that can really save you in a difficult situation yeah yeah take care of those class reports um quite a few of you will be getting something called a temporary resident Visa once your study permit is approved uh this is sometimes it's called a student visa it's something that immigration will put directly into your passport it's just like a sticker that goes on one page this is solely for the purpose of entering Canada think of it as like the key to the door okay you need this to get into the country and that's really all it does it's not a status so it's completely different from your study permit or your work permit it's really just a way to enter Canada initially if your TRV expires while you're in Canada it's okay you're still here you still have a valid study permit not a problem okay again you only need it to travel outside of Canada and re-enter even if you don't have upcoming travel plans it's not a bad idea to renew your TRV when it's expiring just in case an emergency comes up and you have to travel home unexpectedly you know it's good to have that just in case if you're applying for a new TRV from within Canada you would first have to extend your permit okay your study permit and then once that was approved you could then apply to extend your TRV so it's a two-step process once you're inside Canada outside is different right they just automatically approve the trb once you get the study permit approval so keep that in mind it's two separate applications uh other people might be from Visa exempt countries and in this case you don't need a trb you instead you would get something called an electronic travel authorization or ETA for short this is a bit more convenient than a TRV it's just electronically linked to your passport uh you don't get a piece of paper or anything like that just when you come into Canada the officer will read your passport and the ETA will just pop up on their screen they know you have an entry document it is connected to the passport so if you were to get a new passport you would have to apply for a new ETA to connect to that passport it's very quick to apply for one of these takes about 10 minutes online it costs seven dollars and again I would try to make sure you always have an ETA just in case you do need to travel all right so the main thing the most important thing for most of you is going to be your study permit this is what you're going to get when you arrive in Canada it'll be printed out at the airport when you arrive you always have to have a valid study permit while you're in Canada for your studies so don't let this one expire a few things to remember right if you applied with uh an offer letter from another school while you're outside of Canada and then you decided to switch to you Waterloo before you came here it's really important that you notify ircc of that change in schools while they're processing your study permit they need to approve the study permit based on the actual offer of the school that you're going to so if you're in this situation please notify them we'll have details later on how you can do that um if you come into Canada and change your school once you're here that's easier you can just do that online there's a tool for that uh you're required to have the valid study permit and so at least the completion of your studies so this would mean until the university declares a degree awarded at the end of your program you would want to have a ballot study permit to cover that entire period they're typically issued for an additional 90 days beyond your expected program completion date normally the immigration officer will do that some of you might get one that isn't issued the extra 90 days if you don't that's okay you can still extend it once you're here okay so don't feel like it's going to be a major problem you can't extend it if for some reason your study permit were to expire while you're here you would have to restore your status it's really important that you do that within 90 days of losing your status and uh please don't let your study permits expire because you have to stop studying you have to stop working until they approve that restoration you probably want to extend your study permit I'd say one to three months at least before it's set to expire just to maintain your status when you get to the airport and they print out your study permit please check it through very quickly make sure there's no errors sometimes the officer will make a printing error they'll spell your name wrong um they might not include the work conditions so if you look at the airport quickly when they hand it to you and see that there's something missing you can ask them you can say oh I'm sorry but I notice there's no work authorizations it's much easier to correct a problem at the airport than it is later so be be vigilant check those study permits you know when you first get them and you have the officer there in front of you um you really should be allowed to work both on and off campus as grad students at Waterloo so that should be listed there uh if you're in a grad program that has a degree required internship component okay you have to complete an internship as part of your degree then you will need this additional permit called a co-op work permit this allows you to do full-time work during a co-op term for an approved Co-op employer so it is an important one you will need it for those Co-op terms there's no additional fee for a co-op work permit and if you got an offer letter that said you were in a co-op program hopefully immigration will issue both the study permit and the Cooperative permit together in that one application if not let's say you only get the study permit once you get to Canada you can apply for the co-op work permit separately so if you come into Canada you realize you don't have your Co-op work permit you know reach out to us we can assist you with applying for that Co-op work permit it does take about four or five months to process so it's good to do it as soon as you get here if you didn't get one uh so you have it in time for your Co-op placement later in the program you must have this before you begin Co-op work right so there is a timing base with timing importance there um usually the co-op work permit will expire at the same time as your study permit so they'll have the same expiry date you can extend them together as well all right so it's really one in the same application if you're extending there's a lot to keep track of once you're here on the ground at Waterloo I mean there's your program there's the immigration side of things you know it gets busy so if you want a system that sort of allows you to keep track of your immigration documents when they're expiring once you've renew your passport that sort of thing please um check out our immigration document reminder system it's on a portal if you just enable your status as International status through portal and look for the integration reminders tile activate that and you can add the expiry dates of your different documents and then portal will actually message you you know before they expire in in intervals before they expire this is a lifesaver because sometimes you forget you get busy and uh the worst thing is like you know a PhD student you're almost done your thesis you realize you're at a status not good so try to keep track of those expiration dates so you don't go out of status okay transitioning to working in Canada so now you're in Canada you've got your study permit maybe you've got a co-op work permit how much can you work so in order to work while you're studying you must ensure that you do have a valid study permit with the work authorizations listed on it that you can work both on and off campus it's also important that you maintain full-time enrollment so you need to be a full-time enrolled student in the term that you're working in otherwise you can't work at all with the exemption being the final term of studies where it is possible to be part-time and your final term and still work and most importantly you must have begun your program so some of you might get here in August and get your study permit you can't really work until the first day of classes okay so you'll just have to sort of wait until the program starts before taking a job in that scenario you don't need an additional work permit you can work on your study permit it allows you to work in Canada however again if you have a co-op work placement you will need that additional Co-op work permit you also need to get a social insurance number from Service Canada in order to get paid for work in Canada that's very important and if you look at your study permit and it says something like you're not able to work off campus or there's no work conditions at all it's completely blank please contact us immediately because we have to get that corrected before you can legally work in Canada so a quick summary for grad students right you can work both on and off campus so for on-campus work this can be an average of 20 hours per week for an on-campus employer and that's your main campus okay so um you have to be a full-time student and if it's your main campus you can work this restriction is from the Ontario Council of grad studies it's not from immigration okay so just keep that in mind it's a recommendation from the Council of grad studies for off-campus work immigration says that you're allowed to work up to 20 hours per week for an off-campus employer and again you must be a full-time student in order to do so full-time work is only possible off campus during scheduled breaks all right and grad programs don't really have scheduled break terms at Waterloo but there are small schedule breaks throughout the year where you could potentially work full-time on your study permit for example there's a fall break in October there's the winter break the holiday break in December there's reading week in February during those breaks you could transition to full-time work for the duration of the break also in between terms there's sometimes small schedule breaks from the end of the exam period until the beginning of the courses in the next term so there is a little bit of room there for full-time work but it's mostly restricted if you want to get a social insurance number you'll have to wait until you get to Canada because to apply for when you need to show them your valid study permit and you won't get that until you arrive here right um the social insurance number doesn't authorize you to work your study perimeter work permit does but it does allow you to get paid for work in Canada so if you visit Service Canada whether that's you know at their location or maybe on campus they do come here once in a while they will give you a sin that's valid until the date of your permit expiry and uh that number will never change it's always going to be the same number while you're a student even if you renew it it's the same number if you extend your study permit you would want to go to Service Canada once you get the new study permit and show them the new status just so that they can keep your sin record up to date the sin is highly confidential please don't give it out to anyone um it really only your employer should really be asking for it or the government of Canada if they're asking for some reason otherwise it is very confidential and a lot of identity fraud stems from sins being leaked so protect that SIN number you shouldn't just be giving out to anyone you can get your sin um again in person if you go to a Service Canada location um we do have a SIM clinic at the center of needles Hall on campus uh usually once per month and those are scheduled on the portal uh events in the center main page you can register for those and go for a same-day appointment you can also apply online to get your sin and um if you want to apply online you do have to use their specific portal and you'll have to upload a copy of your valid study perimeter work permit and your passport bio data page the main page with your picture and your birth date and things like that so there's different options there depending on how you want to get that sitting but you'll have to do that once you get here in September okay very quickly just going to touch on the post-graduation work permit uh I'm just going to call it a pgwp for short the tgwp is an open work permit and it's available to you once you are degree awarded so once you're officially degree awarded from the Records Office you can get the documents you need from the University to apply for this work permit it's a great opportunity to get Canadian work experience towards permanent residency through Express entry for example uh this is a once in a lifetime permit so if you're a master's student and you complete your Master's you could apply for the post-grad work permit but if you think you're going to go on to PhD studies soon you may not want to apply for it save it for after the PHD because it is a one-time only type thing it's it can be valid for up to three years and um in order to remain eligible for the pgwp you have to be a full-time and continuous student okay so try to avoid any breaks and study or any part-time terms unless it's your final turn final term doesn't really matter but that is important if you need to take a leave of absence um you can talk to one of us about it there's also a system through gspa where they may be able to give you a change of enrollment to an active for authorized leave so if this is something that's inevitable please reach out and get the resources for that so that you're protect it in the future everybody wants to know like how long of a postgrad work permit will I get so the general rule is if you're in a master's program and it's a one-year program so three terms then you're most likely going to get a pgwp issued for one year to match that program like if you're a master's student and you're in a four term 16 month or up to two year program you should be getting a three-year pgwp which is the full maximum length and for PhD students definitely a three year just because of the length of the PG the PHD program okay the last thing I'm going to quickly touch on is coming into Canada so once you do have your study permit approval you know normally what will happen is immigration will request your passport and you'll have to mail that in to a visa application center so that they can attach your TRV your entry Visa unless you're from an electronic travel authorization country then they'll just issue the ETA automatically once you get your passport back you'll have the Visa inside you will also get a letter from immigration that looks like the one on the right here this is called a letter of introduction and the letter says that you're now eligible to travel to Canada for studies and in that box at the bottom there it'll have your document number when your permit expires some other important information you definitely want to print this letter out and carry it with you because you'll have to give it to the cbsa officer so that they can generate your study permit and potentially your Co-op work permit um you'll also want to bring your offer of admission and letter of acceptance which is you know the initial offer letter that you got from the University um if you entered Canada for the first time if you've already started your studies and you're coming in a little bit later let's say you started online you're coming in in October or November for some reason just remember that your offer letter is probably expired it usually expires at the end of September if you're coming in for fall so in this scenario you would also want to get an additional proof of enrollment letter from the center this can be ordered online and you can print it out locally and carry it with you when you travel it'll show that you're currently an enrolled student so it's important to carry both in that scenario but you don't need the proof of enrollment letter if the offer letter is still valid if you want to check the validity date of your offer letter it's on the very last page in that chart it'll say when your offer letter expires it's usually September 20th yeah end of September let's say so check it out just to make sure if you're counting in for a co-op term for some reason you'd want to carry proof that you are in a co-op term although I think for most of you this is not going to apply uh you'll be coming in on a study term other things that you could be asked for when you arrive in Canada proof of financial support so you could have copies of your bank statements uh proof of your funding which would be on your offer letter for example if you've already paid your tuition Quest tuition received uh try not to carry a lot of cash with you if you carry more than ten thousand dollars cash on your person you do have to declare it and pay tax on it so I wouldn't recommend doing that but do carry paper documents that show that you have Financial Resources in case you're asked another thing some of you will have to consider if you're from a designated country which is a country that requires a medical exam uh not a not every country does but some do uh you'll have to get a medical for your study permit application that's valid for 12 months and you want to carry proof of the medical with you when you enter Canada that's very important if for some reason your medical has already expired look you had it over 12 months ago you would have to do a new medical before you travel to Canada so you'd have to go and get an upfront medical exam and carry that with you uh if you're a returning student same idea if you've been outside of Canada for over six months in a medical required country make sure you get that up front medical before you travel back there's also this thing called arrive can it's an app that you can get on your smartphone there's also a website that you can use arrive can through through a browser this was mandatory during covet it's no longer mandatory you don't need to talk about vaccinations or anything like that but we still recommend using it because you can do something called an advanced customs declaration through the app and this is going to save you time once you arrive in Canada uh because you've already done your customs declaration through arrive can it should streamline things a bit so you're not stuck in the airport for three hours right um every every minute matters at that point if you've already applied for your study permit and you think oh no I didn't mention something important or I made a mistake and I need to talk to immigration about my application or let's say you switch schools you're switching to Waterloo and you want to give them the new offer letter you can reach out to immigration they do have country specific Visa office contact information at the following link and you can either fill out a web form or use their priority email which is usually provided at the bottom uh to contact immigration and let them know what you wanted to add or clarify about your study permit application make sure if you're emailing them to include your UCI number your uh the immigration gave you this number after you became an applicant it's usually eight to ten digits so include that include your application number full name um and then let them know what you want to clarify or what documents you want to add if you use the web form it'll sort of walk you through that process and then you can attach documents at the end so you can talk to immigration afterwards it is possible okay wrapping up just to let you know again we are here um we're available to you know talk to you about these things and your applications we offer a lot of immigration information sessions online through teams you can find these in the portal events page about Co-op work permits postgrad work permits working in Canada we do have some presentations on permanent residents um and a few other things like flag polling uh and there's like a full presentation with q a at the end so please check those out once you're here if you want to get more information on these things uh if you think you're in a situation where you may not be able to get your study permit in time for September uh it's still in processing you haven't heard anything from immigration you might want to contact a graduate program coordinator just to let them know that you might not be able to get your study permit for the beginning of the term and look at options there let's see like what else is available if you can't come to Canada immediately whether that's deferral online studies it's good to talk to this person and just get a sense of what your options would be in September in this situation so please use this resource there's a lot of information on this page too and FAQs that might be of use to you going forward okay um just wrapping up we do have a integration web form that you can send in your questions to or request an appointment through and um this is something that we monitor every day we try to answer within two business days if we can but there is volume so be patient and we're also located in South Campus while on the second floor once you're on campus come and see us we can always do an in-person appointment with you and we'd love to meet you and you know hear about your journey and hopefully assist with that so I'm going to wrap up now uh thanks so much for listening and uh yeah best of luck in your your degree studies thanks Clint and next up we'll have Janice spitler from uh Student Financial Services to answer questions you may have in that area well first she's going to have some some of her own content but then later hi everyone I'm Janice fitler and I work in student finance um what I'm going to be presenting for you today uh is more concerned about just the student health plans there's a you hit plan and then supplementary health and dental plan um are you seeing my screen okay my slides yes uh you you are not in presenter view though okay does that matter okay perfect okay so this is what you need to know about your health insurance plans as a student so first thing to know you're going to be charged tuition fees in around July 22nd they'll be on your quest and you'll get an email notification when your fees are on Quest so the first thing you need to know is how do I become fees arranged uh two ways that you can become fees arranged is you would pay your entire term balance you'd make an International Bank payment or you can also do a Canadian Bank payment if you have access to Canadian bank account or you may want to use the promissory note so a lot of grad students have grad funding scholarships bursaries GRS funding you'll want to use a promissory note then if you're not going to make a full payment to pay your full term fees those are two ways once your fees arranged you can check your status on Quest and under the registration status you'll show the fall 2023 term and it'll show from enroll requests it'll change to fees arranged once you've either paid your term balance or you've submitted a promissory note if you have financial aid funding you're going to use so what happens if you're not fees arranged uh you won't receive any of your grad funding you will not have access to some of the things you pay for in your term fees such as the gym or the GRT ion that's the public transportation system there's a light rail Transit train in town and the buses so you can't have access to that until your fees arranged you will not be enrolled as well in either the uhip plan or the supplementary health and dental plans so it's very good tried a bit fees arrange the due date for the term is August 22nd so it's good very good to be fees range by then because everything then flows you get your health plan coverage you can access the the gym and the GRT and and everything flows so hopefully try to be fees arranged by the due date for the term um as I said you need to be fees range to have your health coverage there's two different types of health coverage and a lot of students get very mixed up between the two uh the unit there's a university health insurance plan that's called uhip if short and then there's also the GSA grad Student Association supplementary health plan which is the health plan and a dental plan uhip is your basic health care uhip is going to cover things such as a doctor's visit you need to go to the hospital emergency room that'll be covered you need some lab uh you have to go to the lab for some blood work that's covered under you hip so again medical appointments hospital care diagnostic tests if you want a full list of all the coverage you can just go to uhip.ca and you can see the list of what all is covered there good thing to note about the uhip plan um the effective date it is actually earlier than September the 1st if you come to Canada August 10th between as early as August 10th you'll have coverage under your uhip medical plan um so that's good to know you won't have your coverage card just then probably but the effective date of your coverage is the date you arrive in Canada as early as August the 10th or after uh uhip as well it's compulsory for all International students so you're going to be charged the uhip fee on Quest for your fall term [Music] um and you must contain continue to have you have coverage throughout your your academic uh studies it's also compulsory if there's any returning Canadians if they've been out of the country for a while there's a waiting period for their Ontario health insurance coverage um so if they if you're a returning student you don't have oh hip coverage again olip is the Ontario health insurance plan contact student finance on our portal and we can provide temporary you have coverage up to three months while returning Canadians get their o-hip coverage good to know uhip as well as compulsory for dependents so if you have and dependence is your spouse or children so if your spouse or child is coming to Canada with you or arrives later in Canada it's compulsory that they also have you have coverage and the date of the coverage is their date of arrival in Canada the date of marriage in Canada um and the penalty fee as well is 500 if you do not inform us that you have dependents that are here within 30 days of arrival so very important to remember that if you've got family coming make sure to enroll them in ukip and you can do that on our website how much does uhub cost um the charge has been the same the last few years so that's good it hasn't increased it's very competitive program it costs 756 dollars for the year for one 12 month period but we divide the cost into three charges and charge it to each term the fall term winter term and spring term the cost for one person for one student is 252 per term uh if you have one dependent it's an extra 252 if you have two dependents it's 504 and that's the maximum so if you're a family of of uh if you've got a spouse and two children then you'll just be charged the 504. so how do you get the proof of coverage well you need to be fees arranged so the first enrollment list that I'll do is after the August 22nd due date I will contact Cowan insurance for everyone whose fees arrange by that date Cowan insurance is the one who who handles the uhip insurance they'll email you uh when your you have has been updated and activated and then you go onto their website and you can download the your uhip membership card for the term uh it's all good to note um where do you get your medical services they have uhip has a list of preferred providers so these are all providers who have agreed that you can go to their office their facility and just present your uhip card and they will build directly you don't have to pay up front so some local examples you can go most students use the u-waterloo health services on campus there's also some Waterloo walk-in clinics on the University shops Plaza right near the university another one nearby at the boardwalk Victoria and West Mount these are some other urgent air clinics urgent care clinics as well the emergency rooms at Grand River hospital and St Mary's Hospital those are the two hospitals in in Kitchener Waterloo if you go on the uhip website you can look for the preferred providers it provides you a link it gives you a map so even for example if you're in Toronto and you need to access Services go on there on their website you can see who in Toronto you can go to and just present your card and and they'll build directly if you're traveling in Canada so you're outside of Ontario you still have you have coverage but it's only for medical emergencies only you would take a claim form with you and then you'd have to pay up front and then submit a claim to account insurance to get reimbursed after outside of Canada it's minimal coverage um but and I'll talk about your your GSA Health Plan your GSA Health Plan has traveled out of country travel insurance um so that provides more insurance if you're out of Canada so if you have any changes to your uhip coverage um if you want to add a dependent or perhaps you've had dependents here and they've left and gone back home please contact us other thing to note a lot of grad students later on after graduation or towards the end or you may have a spouse who's got a work permit and you might be eligible your spouse and your you yourself might be eligible for ohip which is the Ontario health insurance plan uhip basically is designed to cover everything that will hit the Ontario health insurance plan covers so if you do get ohip coverage please or one of your dependents does let us know you just have to provide proof of your ohip card and then we can remove your you have coverage because you don't need two different two coverages that are the same so again check the uhip website for information all about your uhip our Student Financial website also has information your membership ID when you get your card your ID is very simple it's just uw0 and your eight digit student ID number and the policy number is zero five zero one five zero so I'll talk a little bit about your GSA graduate student Association insurance plan so this is supplementary to your to your uhip plan this is going to cover things that you have does not cover um one thing that a lot of people get mixed up with is about prescriptions your uhip plan does not pay for any prescriptions but your GSA Health Plan does have I think it's 80 of the cost of your prescriptions um GSA Health Plan also covers things as immunization your travel as I said out of country coverage medical equipment and supplies Health practitioners if you need to see a physiotherapist or if you're getting some counseling that's covered under your GSA health insurance plan also Vision Care I think it's a hundred and twenty five dollars for glasses contacts over two years and also you can visit uh if you need to see an optometrist I think you have coverage for one visit over every two years you also have it or the GSA dental plan and that has basic dental coverage you need your teeth cleaned um I think some basic filling so it does provide I think up to 750 dollars per year for dental coverage um you can enroll your dependents in the GSA insurance plans but you need to contact student care the GSA health insurance plans are done through student care you need to contact them beginning of September to enroll if you want to enroll a family member in in those plans and their website is studentcare.ca you also get your start of term emails there's lots of links that you'll get in July when your fees are added links about ukip and about the student care plan as well and so that's my presentation if you have any questions please feel free to to put them in the chat thank you thanks Janice sorry yeah uh today's presentation so we have a separate funding webinar that's coming up that covers other aspects of graduate student funding but since International students typically tend to have questions mostly about uh the the differences between uh you have been a no-hip plan certain times they ask us why you have exists when they've heard about ohip we figured this is a if we had to pick a certain topic this would be the most relevant to specifically International students but if there's questions about funding in general which uh may or may not have been covered today that does not mean we don't have them on the roadmap it's just that today we had a limited amount of time the rest will be covered in the funding webinar but with that uh our final prison interpreter today Adida thank you hello everybody apologies for my voice I'm a little bit sick right now but hopefully everybody can hear me okay my name is Adida gachni I work with the international student experience team um at the University of Waterloo and I'll just be sharing a little bit about international student experience um supports that are available to you while you're here we'll just share my slide oh um so just to give you a bit of an idea of how many International students we have at the University so we have full-time equivalent in Internet International students so not including part-time studies or students that are here for short-term programs we have around 8 800 Visa status students that being said our department supports any students who identify as International students so you may have lived lived abroad your entire life but have a Canadian citizenship for some reason um or you've done a little bit of studies in Canada et cetera so we try to not limit our programs and services to just students who have a Visa status so you can see we have approximately 40 percent of our student population of graduate students or International and for undergraduate students about 21 are international based on Visa status so this is our lovely team small But Mighty we say our manager Candace Brown Cynthia bertan is an international student support specialist once you're on campus you can actually book one-on-one appointments with Cynthia she can help with different things not related to academics it's a bit of an advising rule but if you're having trouble with housing or you're having trouble finding work and things like that she can connect you to the right people and she also has connections across the city of Waterloo and the City of Kitchener as well so she's a great contact for you to flag for yourself once you arrive to campus then there's myself I oversee the programming team which is Alison Merlot and Connie Chung and then um we do a lot of different things so we have a pre-arrival and transition um section which is what Allison works on and then a current student portfolio as well which is where Connie um does most of her work as well so this is our team feel free to come to our office we're also located in South Campus Hall alongside Clint and the immigration consultant so we always love to see students come into the office so please feel free to come in So within the Student Success office there are several different international student support specifically for international students you can access all of the Student Success office supports and services but there are specific ones for international students so like I mentioned we have some transition supports these are mostly for undergraduate students so I won't go into too much detail but you have the same equivalent for grad students which is what your your involved in today so the webinars we have webinars for undergrad students as well Waterloo ready is the grad ready equivalent for undergraduate students we have a three-day International orientation for undergraduate students that takes place uh prior to first year orientation so this is separate from your grad orientation that'll be taking place in September no need to worry about that piece one piece that I will go into a little bit more detail is the airport pickup program so we have partnered with Airways Transit which is the local uh shuttle service between Pearson International Airport and water the city of Waterloo and Kitchener and so you'll be receiving an email soon the emails haven't gone out yet but you'll be receiving an email soon uh probably the first week of July inviting you to register for a special discount so the University of Waterloo will be covering about 40 percent of the cost of this service for you if you're arriving between August 28th and September 10th so this will all be in an email for you and the instructions of how to register and how to apply this additional discount will be on there as well as a University of Waterloo student you will be receiving a reduced rate already so if you're traveling outside of that two-week period you do still have a reduced rate so you just like that in your in your registration with Airways Transit so that's new for this year we're really excited for this because it'll mean that you're being dropped off uh you're being picked up right at the airport and you're being dropped off right at your home wherever that is if it's on campus or off campus if you have questions about this uh program at all after you receive your email there will be some instructions of how you can connect with us as well and I'll be sharing a contact us slide a little bit later on um if you have questions specific to this right now um another thing to add with the airport pickup we will have a welcome booth at Pearson International Airport at terminal one but we will also be sending staff to terminal 3. so if you're arriving between August 28th and September 10th um you'll see some University of Waterloo staff faculty alumni students supporting you and in welcoming you and then directing you to the different areas at the airport if you need food or if you're looking for Airways Transit if you've registered for that service so that's the airport pickup program also available to you and your family and dependents and supporters as well so the 40 discount is just for students that are eligible incoming first-time students but the reduced rate is also available for your dependents and supporters and we have some current student programming this is for all International students pardon uh the first one that I'll talk about is the breakfast seminar Series so this uh takes place in the fall and winter so you'll see an invitation to this in the newsletter that you'll be Auto subscribed to um breakfast seminars happen we invite different people from across campus who support International students in their programming or services to talk about that specifically and how they can help you in your transition while you're here so we've had different things we've had different folks from across campus come in um you know to help you get your terms started or we have a special session in March for taxes if you're interested in learning more about taxes those types of things will happen during the breakfast seminar program and we also it's called breakfast seminars because we do offer a hot free meal for you if you register for this program as well and there's some networking opportunities for you in this program next we have the international peer Community this is a peer-to-peer geared program um you know again for all students undergraduate and graduate students mixed in there's a lot of social events and different things for you to be able to do um on and off campus to help you build some of those social connections meet new people and adjust to life in in Waterloo and in Canada and we do different things we have a bonfire that's going to be happening in September so again this will be shared in the newsletter so you don't have to scribble everything down or try to remember now that it's you know it's June and we're talking about September here and then we have our you winter Lou winter program so for many students winter in Canada can be a difficult or challenging time and so we recognize that and want to have as much support available to you as possible and so you can register uh for the you interlude program for some support during the month of December we have again some social events to connect you with others who are also on campus or staying around town and then um a series of newsletters to to help you adjust to Winters in Canada so some tips and things like that in there as well as coupons and giveaways and things like that as well immigration Consulting as as you just heard Clint cover many many uh awesome supports from the immigration Consulting team I will go into into any detail there but also part of the Student Success office and then we have our communication so a really helpful tool for you as the international student guide I always recommend when I talk to students before they arrive I always recommend the international student guide it's an online web page and there are so much information in there we just updated a lot of the information um just in May so it's all up to date for you and ready for your eyes and feel free to browse around in there um for more information there's information for your family there's information for yourself preparing to come information for you while you're here to support with your academics Etc so definitely check that out if you haven't already and you'll probably get some um some links and things in your emails coming up as well to those if you haven't already then we have the international student connection e-newsletter so this is the newsletter I was saying you'll be Auto subscribed to starting in September so the first Wednesday of every month you'll receive a nice long newsletter full of really important information for you so Clint's team also supports that and there's lots of up very up-to-date immigration information on there as well as any of the workshops that they have and things like that and then we also have some of this current student programming information in there as well as other campus Partners will um or folks around campus will also have you know their information shared in there for you as well so it's very timely information that is dropped into your inbox uh the first Wednesday of every month and then as our next is our contact us page I think there's going to be a link dropped in the Q a so if you need to connect with our team at all we do have a live chat feature so you can chat with Connie who you saw in the picture prior to a couple slides back um Connie oversees the live chat so she's happy to answer questions there you can also book a virtual call or just email us if you have questions about anything we're we try to be on top of our emails like Clint mentioned in his presentation sometimes it gets quite busy especially at this time of the year so give us a few days to respond to your inquiry but we promise we'll get there such as patients um with those emails it's a busy time for folks on campus and I just wanted to cover some supports outside of the Student Success office so they're if you're looking at English language supports or places you can go to support your English language development there's a lot of different places you can go to so we have a writing and Communication Center which is actually also in the same building as the Student Success office it's in South Campus Hall and they host English conversation circles uh once a week that you can register for that those are hosted by their staff and so you have some structured time to practice your English language with some some tools and resources available to you as well and then they also offer workshops so they even offer workshops on on you know on how to write your resume and cover letter and um how to set up your LinkedIn profile and things like that so lots of really cool workshops coming from the writing and Communication Center as well and then we have an English Language Institute which is part of Renaissance University College an affiliate of the University of Waterloo it's just a hop over the little river that runs through our campus and they also host con conversation partner program it's not something you have to register for necessarily so a little bit different from the writing and Communication Center there but a lot of um opportunity for casual conversation to take place that's not as structured as The Writing Center and then they do also have graduate and undergraduate credit courses if you're interested in just taking some extra courses specifically to support your English language that's a great place to go so that's the English Language Institute and then for those of you who are arriving to campus or to Waterloo with spouses or Partners um we have the international spouses of Waterloo program which is offered through Nancy Matthews who's been part of the university for many many years and runs programming and events for spouses and partners of UW students so if you if your spouses and partners are coming with you and are worried about making friends or meeting new people or having some structure in their life as well this is a great program for them as well so that's kind of that's the the gist of what we're here for and what we do to support you while you're here if you would like to reach out to me you can feel free to email me my email is right there and my um phone number is there as well for the office and then our international student experience team email is uh linked there as well as the the again the phone number if you'd like to make a call and then you can visit our website there at the bottom that will cover all international student resources so everything that I've just covered uh everything isn't on that page as well so if you want a quick glimpse of what's covered uh or what's available to you sorry uh that's a great place to go for you as well that is it from me I will just stop sharing my screen here and thank you so much and wishing you the best of luck and so excited to see you on campus and please come visit us in South Campus Hall when you have a moment take care safe travels thank you so much Anita all right so we will try to get to some of the questions that are in the Q a uh although the presenters happened typing them in uh the others were speaking so thank you for that uh this one is a question that it seems like it's for uh Clint I'm an international student and I have already received my study permit do I need to submit a photocopy to the university to confirm my incoming ah um good question I think that was a requirement several years ago that you had to update the school with your permits but it no longer is mandatory from our knowledge um you don't have to upload a photocopy of your status in order to begin your studies in September it thank you Clint uh I don't know who this question is for exactly also I'll just read it out and let's see who's comfortable taking it or we can just archive it for now what vaccinations do we need to take and provide as documents to enroll at the University of Waterloo um from an immigration perspective you don't there's no mandatory vaccinations needed at this point in time there was during the height of covet but those have been eliminated um but I'm not sure about the university side of things if any requirements there still or couldn't speak to that sorry yeah I'm sorry I'm not sure either not that nothing that I've heard of from our end either yeah you know yeah sorry go ahead I traveled in March abroad which I would say is fairly recent and while coming back I did not see any requirements as such on the airport or just otherwise uh to submit any kind of proof vaccination anywhere so um not exactly the answer but I was carrying everything but you know nobody asked anything so it's reminding me of a trip we recently took to the states if you're traveling to the states to the United States um certain States will still ask for verification that you've received to um covet vaccines so that was in April so very reason threw us off at the airport a little bit but we had it thankfully um but not something we were prepared to have to share so if you're planning on doing some traveling for whatever reason I know sometimes there's conferences and things like that just make sure you're checking with the airline you're traveling with to see if there's any vaccines you might need before you travel okay I see a couple of questions for SDS so I'm going to Bunch them together I'm expecting my final semester eight semester results in July so I'm assuming the person is talking about eight semester okay uh okay anyway I'm expecting my final semester results in July can I apply for SDS now as I have my medical report funding reports and all the necessary things I need and the second and separate but same topic question is is academics important for SDS Visa okay um yeah SDS like for those watching it not sure what that is it's sort of a a prioritized application process if you meet all these conditions up front and only certain countries can take advantage of it at this point in time um this is the link to sort of the main page if you want to get started looking at this oh that's a giant link but that should take you through too uh the SDS page uh if you are still waiting for your final transcripts from your school uh outside of Canada there's two options there you could wait until you get that and then apply for the SBS or you could try applying now if you need all the other requirements and then once you get the final transcripts you could upload them via web form um through the web form portal we discussed earlier and uh it should still be looked at by the officer when they're assessing your application SDS is supposed to take 20 days to process but in our experience it can take longer I think that's a very idealized number unfortunately it could take up to two months um so in general if you can apply now and then upload additional proof later that might be the way to go if there's a time crunch and what was the second part of that question again is academics important for SDS okay I mean it's not supposed to be the primary thing that immigration is looking at uh so they they do kind of look at academic performance overall but it shouldn't be a deal breaker in terms of getting a refusal on a study permit application although recently there was sort of a landmark decision in the Supreme Court of Canada where a person was refused for a study permit based on core academics but this was an extreme situation okay so keep that in mind like I think for most of you here academics are going to be quite good and I don't think you need to stress about that right so I yeah I think what you're trying to say Clint is like it's they're not trying to turn it into like a competition where only the best performing ones get the visa they're just trying to like the extreme cases where they end up refusing is just out of concern that they just genuinely might struggle right in in just being a student in in a university abroad so it's almost sort of looking out for them rather than sort of saying them you're not going to be able to perform and it's not a competition as such right yeah I don't think that you're being graded on a curve or anything like that there's nothing like that and you do have an offer letter from the school so right that's the main thing exactly and I think the next question is sort of a nice one because uh Adida can speak to the just the sort of integration piece and then Clint can speak to the documentation side of things and travel side of things so somebody's asking I'm planning to arrive on campus uh by 13 on 13th of September is it possible how much will I miss yeah I can I can go first if you'd like Clint I feel like you might have some more to share um so what at that point you will have missed the grad orientation um in-person content however the stuff that's on the grad ready the learn modules that you've probably already seen that stuff will be around for you all year round so um definitely recommend to keep looking in there because the in-person components the in-person orientations are usually kind of they go hand in hand with the content that's shared on learn so you're not gonna miss anything brand new you might miss opportunities to network with your peers or staff faculty Etc uh but you shouldn't there shouldn't be anything brand new that's shared during orientation that you wouldn't have already had access to through your learned content as well as your pre-arrival emails that you will have been receiving already so just keep keep an eye on that um so yes you will miss of course like the in-person events um that are taking place but there's other things that are other opportunities for you to connect with the folks once you start your classes and things like that but I'll let Clint speak to some of the documentation or things like that that might be impacted sure um I'm looking at the academic calendar so I guess the courses officially begin on the sixth right so you'd be coming in like a week late um from an immigration perspective I mean that's totally fine it doesn't invalidate your permit or anything like that you do have the letter of introduction you do have the offer letter from the school and that's still valid it should be still valid until the end of September so I think you could just enter with your offer letters proof of your enrollment even if it's a bit late but again if you're coming up towards the end of September or you're looking at early October you would need that additional proof of enrollment from the center to just show that you are currently an active student because the offer letter would be expired at that point so keep that in mind um yeah um I I just realized thank you Clint and Adida but I just realized that maybe even Janice has some pointers for people who are planning on arriving a little late in terms of any part of the process that is in person which I don't think it is actually but dates to keep in mind from a finances standpoint if there are uh Janice sorry I was answering questions I didn't hear this last one I was uh what was the question so the question first from somebody was I am planning on arriving late but which was 13 September for the fall and they were say how much they were asking how much am I going to miss or is it even possible to start that late uh when it's your first term and I was edita and Clint were just giving their perspectives from like just integration as a student and immigration standpoints and I was just wondering if there's anything to keep in mind from a financial standpoint well with the grad Department I know you are unenrolled like you have to be fees arranged so the student can arrive late um and still be fees arranged I I don't know if they're asking more what they're going to miss right I would probably speak with their grad coordinator um right probably not advisable but uh as long as you can be freeze arranged without being here physically which yeah you don't even have to be fees arranged by August 22nd but dates to keep in mind um students who are not fees arranged I think it's by end of September the grad department will unenroll you from your courses and I think by end of October you'll be unenrolled from your program if you're not fees arranged so you can be it's okay if you if you're not fees range by August 22nd nothing bad is going to happen um you will have a fees arranged extension charge added to your your fees once you have paid your fees so those extension charges uh start so everybody's full time they start I think at fifty dollars and goes up to a maximum of 130 dollars so there's a like typically we used to call it a late fee but now it's called a fees arranged extension charge so if you're not fees range by August 22nd that's okay um but there are important dates I think you need to be fees arranged by end of September so you're not unenrolled by the grad department and I think end of October so that you're not unenrolled from your program because the grad department will unenroll students and that's the grad Department not not student finance that's good to know I hope that answers the question from different standpoints for uh whoever was asking this and I see that questions are continuing to come in so just in order to direct and make sure that we are staying in within time I am requesting that anybody who has questions Beyond well first of all I want to check in with the the presenters if they have a few more minutes to to keep working on the questions maybe 10 more minutes okay so in that case uh I request for for anybody who was still typing their questions in to pause at this point because realistically I think we have enough for the next 10 minutes that doesn't mean we won't get to your questions I'm just going to share my screen for one second to show if you have questions further where you can post them so I'm inside learns uh Waterloo grad ready fall 2023 container and any questions Beyond say 10 45 it's 10 47 now so any questions Beyond 10 45 that were asked I request that you go to the discussion lists I'll do it again discussions and then you keep scrolling down and you'll find International students webinar which is just a place for you to keep posting the follow-up questions and create a new thread and just type that question in so that we can help liaison between the presenters from today and yourself and and sort of give you the answer over here you can also post as Anonymous here so don't worry about uh you know your name being shared if you don't want it so I request that you do that instead of continuing to type it in the Q a because I don't think we're going to be able to get to anything past 10 45. but if you do that we can help you get the answers and mind you that each each presenter also shared uh ways to get in touch with them directly this is just an additional way that we're giving you as an option but whatever makes the most sense to you all right so I'm going to go up from say 10 45-ish now uh all right so this question is for Janus how can we contact you regarding Financial query so I think we already sort of covered that uh there's also sort of a reach out uh contact us page for SFS and I think you just and correct me if I'm wrong uh Janice but if you just ask the question uh the web form sort of handles who exactly does the question go to so if it's about you have if it's about the kind of stuff that Janice is going to answer then you don't have to worry about finding Janice the question is going to find her you can also a quick and easy way email us our email works at SFS you waterloo.ca and that turns into what we call a jira ticket so you can submit on our web page but if it's easier you can just email us SFS at uwaterloo.ca and that'll turn into a gr ticket perfect okay I already uh typed that in in the Q a so whoever had that question all right I'm going up from 10 45 now all right I think another follow-up for Janice again is it possible to extend my insurance validity if I plan on arriving late July maybe even by paying an additional Top-Up fee yeah the earliest the uhip insurance will start is August 10th so if you're arriving before August 10th you should purchase Private health insurance so that you've got coverage till July uh August the 10th and then your GSA health and dental plans they don't start till September the 1st they don't have the early coverage option um okay perfect all right uh I saw a Visa one which I thought we should get to 44. my program is listed as a 16 month program but I plan to complete it in 12 months will I be eligible for a three-year pgwp yeah you want to be careful here um because I know a lot of students have the opportunity to sort of Fast Track and finish that four-term degree in three terms right but the problem is immigration will assess both your completion letter which lists like the average program length and they'll assess your transcripts so if you only have three terms in the transcript the officer could very well just issue you a one-year postgrad work permit and um from my knowledge University of Waterloo doesn't have any sort of officially accelerated options for grad programs some schools do um but Waterloo does not so immigration would want to see that it was described specifically as an accelerated option in the academic calendar in order to exempt you for the full three year I I don't think there is a risk there if you do it in three terms thank you Clint uh all right I saw a couple of questions which somebody answered but it was around uh the passport expiring sort of right after or close to their arrival in Canada so does is there an option to extend the study permit if you get a like a new passport yeah if your passport is expired next year for example I mean you won't get a very long study permit right it'll just be until next year but as long as you manage to renew your passport before your current study permit expires you can then apply for an in-canada extension and the important thing to remember here for example I think this person said their passports expiring on June 1st next year right so if you get your new passport let's say in may even and then apply online to extend your status before June 1st you do maintain your status in Canada you could continue studying working until they make the decision on the approval um but don't delay in renewing those passports right um because sometimes it does take several weeks if you're in Canada to get a new passport issued you don't want to miss out on the expiry date on your study permit um get your applications in before that if you can uh I saw a question that was uh I felt was a good for Dita and so there was a question about campus oh I think you got it never mind uh yeah all right University ambassadors okay uh yeah that's a good question and to just add to what Adidas said somebody asked about University ambassadors that you can talk to about coming to Canada and guiding the process so there's a couple of things that at least at as a part of grad ready we are offering over and above uh you know all the resources that Adida mentioned which through the networking opportunities you get a chance to sort of talk to so many people that it's sort of built in that they will inevitably because the university is an environment is just pretty friendly you will talk to somebody and if you ask them a question about whatever process of coming to Canada you have uh you will get answers but specifically we have uh the in-person orientation where you'll be able to talk to peers and people who are who've been here for a while uh then that's after you come here we also have uh faculty-wise webinars that we're hosting as a part of grad ready which means uh engineering students who are going to start say Masters or PhD in engineering will be able to hear from existing Masters and PhD students from faculty of engineering and then so on for arts and and you know so on so forth so you can ask specific questions about doing grad studies at that faculty to them uh and then like Adida said you can also connect to your peers through the the learn platform so those are the things that I can think of we are also doing like speed trending Stuff Etc so uh lots of options depending on what your preference is but I don't think we have like dedicated ambassadors as such which I don't think we need just because it's pretty decentralized and you will you will find the support if you need it all right [Music] um one last question before we probably wrap up just because it's 10 55 and I want to be mindful of time somebody asked if there is a wrong degree oh on my receipt from Quest it shows a wrong degree program enrolled and my fee which I've paid against that amount Can I submit this to ircc for study permit that's an interesting one I think usually it's it might not be the exact it's the area that it's showing that you're enrolled in it might not be the exact program but I'm sure it's fine to submit that um I've never heard from anybody who's come back and said they needed to change it because it was not accepted right I wonder if it's it's sort of showing the faculty in which they're enrolled instead of a degree and that's causing the discrepancy yeah I think we get some students that shows that instead but I've never heard that that's a problem so I would just submit it all right so I know questions are still coming in uh so I'll just I'll just uh one more time I'll go through so we won't be doing any more questions unfortunately we're out of time uh for the live portion um but once again if you go to learn and you just copy the question that was unanswered or you need a follow-up on from the Q a right now and you just go to learn inside fall 2023 and inside that there's a section called discussions and you just post it under under today's webinar name right here so I hope you can see my screen but under fall 2023 you scroll all the way down under discussions you'll see International students webinar and yeah people have already started posting the follow-ups in there so thank you so much for that that helps us streamline anything that you still maybe need clarification on or we missed that way I yeah you don't feel like we just ignored your question but we're just trying to be mindful of time thanks again for all the presenters uh they stepped in and really took care of a lot of questions even by just typing the response game but uh thank you again for uh being a part of this webinar if you have five minutes uh please take the survey we are posting the link in the Q a it's it's less than a minute all it does it lets us and the presenters today know what we could have done better for instance uh one of the feedback we got in an earlier iteration was please more time for Q a and clearly you can see that even adding like 30 minutes at the end uh has not been enough so but it used to be only 10 minutes and we've changed it to 30 which clearly is is what was needed but you can also scan the QR code on the slide that is up right now or take use the link in the chat or the Q a and take the survey let us know how we did so that we can improve these webinars and serve you better but thanks again for joining and thanks to the presenters and the moderators and everybody supporting the webinar in the background have a great day ahead
